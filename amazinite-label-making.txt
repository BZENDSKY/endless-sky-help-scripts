Map Labels: If you're creating a new label for the map (like the "The Core" or "Paradise Planets" text that you can see over certain regions of space), then follow this process.

Download InkScape (https://inkscape.org/).
Create text with the Zapfino font (you may need to find a download for this), 24-point.
Set the tracking (i.e. spacing between letters) to 24 px, and the fill color to bbc04030.
Create a curve and use Text -> Put on Path to make the text follow that path. Adjust it as appropriate (possibly adjusting the spacing of individual letters to avoid overlapping the map text), then export as a PNG.
